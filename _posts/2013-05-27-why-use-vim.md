vim let you do every thing with keyboard,without mouse，
doing that let you remember all the skill and tricks by cerebellum.
so, you can concentrate your mind in your tasks,you need not to think about how to operate the editor.
just like walk without think。that‘s the important difference between vim and other plain text editors.
